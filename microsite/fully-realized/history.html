                <p>During the Tang dynasty (618–907), tea in China was steamed and compressed into bricks for storage
                    and trade. As described in The Classic of Tea by Lu Yu (760–762), preparation involved roasting and
                    grinding the tea, then boiling it in water with salt until it foamed. Additional ingredients like
                    green onions, ginger, jujubes, mandarin peel, and mint were sometimes added, creating a savory,
                    spiced beverage.</p>

                <h2>Japan</h2>
                <p>Tea was introduced to Japan in the 9th century by the monk Eichū, who brought it from China and
                    served it to Emperor Saga in 815. The tea, likely a Chinese-style compressed tea, was boiled rather
                    than steeped. Inspired by this, Emperor Saga ordered tea plantations to be established in the Kinki
                    region in 816, though tea’s popularity declined shortly afterward.</p>

            <h2>Powdered vs Compressed Tea</h2>

            <p>During the Song dynasty (960–1279), powdered tea became popular in China. Steamed and dried tea leaves
                were
                ground with a niǎn and whisked with hot water, creating a frothy drink similar to modern matcha. Though
                the
                term "matcha" wasn’t used yet, this method likely began by the 11th century. Key texts like Record of
                Tea by
                Cai Xiang and Treatise on Tea by Emperor Huizong described this preparation using high-quality
                compressed
                teas like Dragon and Phoenix Lump Tea. Tea powder was sifted and whisked in bowls, with finer powder
                creating floating foam and coarser powder sinking.<br><br>
                Some versions of imperial tea included additives like borneol or fat for appearance and aroma, though
                these
                were criticized for masking the tea’s natural scent. White tea color was ideal at the time, achieved
                through
                special processing techniques. Song tea practices later influenced Japanese temple tea traditions at
                places
                like Kennin-ji and Engaku-ji.</p>

        <h2>Decline of Compressed Tea Popularity</h2>

        <p>During the Song dynasty, producing lump tea was a complex, expensive process requiring skilled labor, making
            it accessible only to the elite. The traditional bitter-sweet flavor of Tang-era tea gave way to a new
            preference for aroma, sweetness, and smoothness. As lump tea became more refined and costly, its popularity
            declined. In 1391, Ming emperor Zhu Yuanzhang banned compressed tea, shifting Chinese tea culture toward the
            simpler practice of steeping loose leaves—still common today. Early in the Ming dynasty, regional teas were
            still presented to the emperor, as noted in Unofficial Gleanings of the Wanli Era.</p>
