    <h2>Storing Guide</h2>
    <p>To keep your bread moist, allow it to cool completely then wrap in a layer of plastic wrap and then store in a freezer size zip-top bag, or a large plastic container with a tight fitting lid.  It will last on the counter for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 6 days.  Alternately, you can wrap and freeze for up to 2 months.  </p>
